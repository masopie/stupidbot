# Visjar

![](misc/visjar.png)

## Synopsis

Visjar is a slack bot powered by Natural Language Understanding, which means that unlike other slackbots, this one is not only aware of simple unix-like commands, but can also understand sentences and complex requests.


During its development, we tried to create this slackbot in a way people could easily install, configure and customize it. The first, and obvious, thing to do was to offer the possibility to install Visjar in on click, thanks to the Slack button ([here](https://slackbot.recast.ai)). And the second, was to open source Visjar, and produce a detailed README, for the developers to use ([there](https://github.com/RecastAI/visjar)).

## Installation

1. Get the project and move in the folder (`git clone git@github.com:recastAI/visjar.git && cd ./visjar`)
2. Create the parameters file from the .dist (`cp config/parameters.yml.dist config/parameters.yml`)
3. Add a new Slack integration under [services/new/bot](slack.com/services/new/bot) and copy the API token
4. Get the token from your `visjar` app on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai)
5. Get a token from your [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) for `Google Places API Web Service`, `Google Static Maps API`, `Google Maps Geocoding API` and `Custom Search API` (Optional)
6. Get a [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/) token (Optional)
7. Paste your tokens and fill your preferences in the parameters.yml file (`ed config/parameters.yml`)
8. Install the dependencies (`gem install bundler && bundle`)
9. Run the daemon (`./bin/visjar`)

## Usage

![](misc/visjar.gif)

The workflow inside Visjar is as follows:

* Check if the message received is a **direct** message (via @visjar or as DM)
* If it is, send the message to [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) to get the underlying **intent**
* If an intent is returned, send it to the corresponding **command**
* **Repeat**

Here's the list of the currently implemented commands:

* Default politeness (Greetings, Goodbyes, Feelings, Thanks, Help, Compliments, Insults)
* Settings (location for weather cast and restaurant finding, language for the news)
* Weather cast
* Restaurant finding
* News
* Google search
* Website status check

## Configuration

Most of the configuration must be done in the `parameters.yml` file in order to have a default visjar working.
Visjar is relying on several APIs to provide you those commands, and here's a breakdown of what command uses which API:


The `eat` command uses Google Geocoding, Google Places and Google Static Maps.

The `weather` command works with Google Geocoding and Forecast.io.

The `news` and `up` commands doesn't have an API dependency.

The `search` command relies on Google Custom Search.


All the commands Visjar can perform are situated in `lib/commands/` and are loaded during boot by the file `config/environment.rb`.
You can easily add a new command by creating a new file in the commands folder and add a requiring line in the environment file.
